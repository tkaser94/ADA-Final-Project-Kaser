## Project Title: Investigating the effect of healthcare engagement following violent injury for protecting against reinjury.

## Objectives

**Primary Objective:** Determine whether accessing healthcare following
a violent injury is associated with lower odds of violent reinjury.

**Secondary Objective:** Determine whether injury type modifies the
association between accessing healthcare following violent injury and
violent reinjury.

**PICOT

-   P - Victims of violence

-   I - Accessing professional medical care following injury, including
    hospital, ED, clinic visit, and behavioral health visit

-   C - People who did not access any form of professional medical care
    following violent injury

-   T - 01/01/2021 - 12/31/2021


**Data source:** National Crime Victimization Survey, [United States],
2021 (ICPSR 38429)

-   Link:
    <https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NACJD/studies/38429/datadocumentation>

**Primary exposure:** Receipt of healthcare services post violent injury

**Primary outcome:** Violent reinjury (binary Y/N) Hypothesized
moderator: injury type

## The DAG

Link: (<http://dagitty.net/dags.html?id=K0ouMx>)

![](DAG_10.23.png)

The DAG revealed the minimum set of covariates that need to be adjusted
for:

**Covariates**

-   Age

-   Sex

-   Race

-   Law Enforcement involvement

-   Relationship between offender and victim

-   Whether the incident occurred at or near the victim's residence

## Load libraries

```{r Libraries}
#open libraries
pacman::p_load(haven, tidyverse, naniar, VIM, mice, lattice, table1, lubridate, DiagrammeR) 
```

## Load incident data

```{r Load incident data}
# Load incident data
load("C:/Users/15416/OneDrive/Documents/Fall 2022/ADA/Final Project/ICPSR_38429/DS0004/Incident_Data.rda")

# Rename dataframe
incident_data <- da38429.0004
rm(da38429.0004)

## Merge Datasets

```{r Merge datasets and exclude household screen questions}

  # individual or household screen question

  # Next line: Code from IPCSR codebook strips strings from values - leaving only numbers
  mutate(ind_vs_hh = as.numeric(sub("^\\(0*([0-9]+)\\).+$", "\\1", ind_vs_hh))) %>%
